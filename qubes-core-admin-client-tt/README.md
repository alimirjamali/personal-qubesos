# `qubesadmintt` notes
The tools provided here are Tweaks to the original _qubesadmin_ part of
[qubes-core-admin-client](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-client)
repository. Tweaked version of the original tools will have a `-tt` suffix.

## Internals & Features

### Core `qubesadmintt` Tweaks
All of the core classes, methods and properties are inherited from _qubesadmin_
base class with the following exception:
- `QubesArgumentParser`, `VmNameAction` and `VmNameGroup` classes of
`qubesadmin.tools` are overridden to add Unix like Wildcard matching support
to the admin utilities which support more than one VM (i.e. _qvm-check-tt,
qvm-kill-tt, qvm-ls-tt, qvm-pause-tt, qvm-remove-tt, qvm-shutdown-tt,
qvm-start-tt, qvm-unpause-tt_). So you could use `qvm-ls-tt fedora*`,
`qvm-kill-tt disp*`, ...
- `qubesadmin.spinner` is modified to allow cool braille alphabet based spinner.
With further funny ones to come (see ToDo).

### `qvm-check-tt` Tweaks
In addition to Wildcard support, there are `--internal` and `--servicevm`
options.

### `qvm-ls-tt` Tweaks
Forked from the original
[qvm_ls.py](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-client/blob/main/qubesadmin/tools/qvm_ls.py)
code, there are additional improvements to it:
- A _perf_ output format is added. Run `qvm-ls-tt --help-formats` to see what
data it provides. *MAXMEM* column is now available.
- The `--active` option shows all VMs but Halted ones.
- The `--class` options allows to filter output to one or more class of VMs
(AppVM, TemplateVM, ...).
- The `--label` options allow filtering of results based on VM label.
- The `--basedon` option allows filtering to VMs based on specific template.
- The `--connects-width` options allows filtering to VMs using specific NetVM.
- The `--servicevm <yes|no|both>` option allows filtering based on to ServiceVMs.
- Filtering of VMs based on **internal** feature tag is possible via
`--internal <yes|no|both>` option. 
- Sorting with any column rather than name is now possible with `--sort COLUMN`
option. `--reverse` and `--ignore-case` sub-options are available.

## Installation & Removal
To install the tools at your `~/bin` and the libraries at your `~/.local/lib`,
directories, run this command in the current directory.
```
make install
```
To remove them from your system, run this command in the current directory:
```
make remove
```

## Limitations, Issues & ToDo
- The online Qubes OS developerâ€™s documentation
[document](https://dev.qubes-os.org/en/latest/) provided useful help on the
modules, tools, functions, ...
- Only tested on Qubes OS 4.2.1. Backward compatibility is unknown.
- Filtering of VMs based on last access dates should be added to `qvm-ls-tt`
- Cool terminal [spinners](https://github.com/manrajgrover/py-spinners) should
be added with option for user to select their desired one via a _.conf_ file.
- Add ANSI color output option for labels
