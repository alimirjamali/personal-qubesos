### Highlights
- Significant work on **qubes-ansible**

### Details
In addition to the usual minor fixes and patches (full list [here](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2025-09-01..2025-09-07)):

* **ansible** [v1.2.1-1](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6012) (r4.3)
  **ansible** [v1.2.0-1](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6009) (r4.3)
. We had two releases last week with over 50 commits & almost 3000 lines of code added to the repository. Those are the 2nd & 3rd official packaging of `qubes-ansible` for Qubes OS (only r4.3).
. Debian and Archlinux packaging for `qubes-ansible-vm` (in case user wants to use a Debian or Archlinux template for `default_dispvm`).
. To isolate dom0 from target qube, a DispVM proxy is used. This patch alone is over 500 lines.
. Another PR to assure (Ansible) strategy is properly switched from direct connection to DispVM proxy.
. Update to main README file to mention exact package names which user has to install in dom0 and (`default_dispvm`) template to enable `qubes-ansible`.
. Support for most of qube properties.
. Support for device assigning/un-assigning. Briefly looking at the code, it appears to use the New Devices API. So backporting `qubes-ansible` to r4.2 might be impossible.
. Support for tags.
. Support for performing specific tasks based on qube (running) state.
. A lot of unittests and other bug fixes.

* **desktop-linux-kde** [v6.2.0-3](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6010) (r4.3)
Adding two missing dependencies.

#### Epilogue
While I am (currently) by no means, a `qubes-ansible` expert, an Ansible expert or even a SaltStack expert, I can advise on the following:
1. The current main repository to follow `qubes-ansible` developments is [github.com/QubesOS/qubes-ansible](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-ansible). Which is forked from Frédéric Pierret work which itself was forked from Kushal Das original work. Some search engines might show the last two repos as the 1st result. It may take some time for them to show the current packaged collaborative repo as their 1st result.
2. Issues or bugs should be reported to [github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues). Please do not open issues in any of the development repositories mentioned in previous point.
3. There is a dedicated [forum thread](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues) for `qubes-ansible`. Good for discussions which are better suited for forum rather than Github.
4. There is [documentation on readthedoc](https://qubes-ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). But it is kinda outdated in many places. As an example, it advises on cloning Kushal Das original work as current upstream development branch.
