### Highlights
- **Qubes OS r4.3 rc4** is released. Official announcement [here](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qubes-os-4-3-0-rc4-is-available-for-testing/37742).

### Details
In addition to the usual minor fixes and patches (full list [here](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2025-12-01..2025-12-07)):

* **qubes-template-whonix-workstation-18** [4.3.0-202512071252](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6253) (r4.3)
  **qubes-template-whonix-gateway-18** [4.3.0-202512071252](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6252) (r4.3)
  **qubes-template-kicksecure-18** [4.3.0-202512071252](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6251) (r4.3)
    Build of Whonix workstation failed. But the other two succedded. Whonix and Qubes teams are working on this.

* **qubes-release** [v4.3-0.11](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6250) (r4.3)
    - Qubes release r4.3 is updated to **rc4**.
    - For people on older r4.3 rc3, just update the system to upgrade to rc4.
    - This might be the last release candidate before final r4.3 release.
    - Based on the information I have received, pull-requests for new drastic changes & features might be eligible only for the next Qubes OS release (r4.4? r5?).

* **core-admin-addon-whonix** [v4.3.4](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6249) (r4.3)
    - Whonix core addon fixes for preloaded Whonix based DispVMs to assure they do not bypass Tor.
    - Fix for Whonix StandaloneVMs.

* **mgmt-salt-dom0-virtual-machines** [v4.3.13](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6248) (r4.3)
    - Increasing the minimum required free memory for preloaded disposables from 1000MB to 1500MB. This was necessary on older machines (e.g. x230 16GB RAM) to avoid adverse effects. If you are on older r4.3 release candidates on such machiens and you are experiencing issues with preloaded disposables, you may assure that the reserved free memory is at least 1500MB (mine has been 4000).

* **qubes-template-fedora-42-xfce** [4.3.0-202512040155](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6247) (r4.3)
  **qubes-template-debian-13-xfce** [4.3.0-202512040043](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6245) (r4.3)
    A fresh set of new templates with all fixes.

* **notification-proxy** [v1.0.7](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/6243) (r4.3)
    - A patch from two weeks ago was reverted since the project to allow delayed GUI agent connection is not yet finalized. Once that is finalized, we should experience noticeable performance improvements with preloaded disposables. I hope I can record a demo GIF for next newsletter.

#### Epilogue
December is statistically the month with most donations to FOSS projects. Traditionally many FOSS projects have their fund-raising campaign during this month. If any of the newsletter readers feel comfortable with donation to Qubes OS project, [here](https://www.qubes-os.org/donate/) is how to donate.

In the meantime, if anyone wants to generously donate some AMD Zen5 hardware to Qubes OS project for testing/debugging and has a spare unused one, they would be very kind to contact the core team.
