Summer break week.

It was the summer break before the new school/academic [calendar 2024-2025](https://publicholidays.pl/school-holidays/) in Poland and many other countries.

#### Epilogue
Last two weeks were extremely busy due to upgrade of dom0 to Fedora 41 for r4.3 with Xen 4.19. I am planning to try an in-place upgrade of dom0 to Fedora 41 on the test machine to see if it breaks anything.
