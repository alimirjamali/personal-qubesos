### Introduction
Weekly review of new packages uploaded to Qubes OS repositories. Notes on how it is prepared and what resources are used to write this newsletter is available in [previous versions](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qubes-os-updates-weekly-review-y2024-w37/28989).

### Highlights
- Fewer new updates due to Qubes OS Summit 2024 in Berlin
- Salt broke
- Qubes OS  R4.2.3 final version release

### Details

- [core-admin v4.2.34](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin/compare/v4.2.33...v4.2.34) (r4.2)
Marking Intel BE200 WiFi interface as certified on Novacustom V56 laptops. This one is better than the previously certified Intel AX211 card.

- [salt v3006.9-2](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-salt/compare/v3006.9-1...v3006.9-2) (r4.2 & r4.3)
Salt broke due to a Python update of `urllib.parse` module on Fedora 40, 39 & 38 (maybe other distro as well). Marek's patch to upstream has been in review for 5 days and is still not merged at the time of this post. So a patch to Qubes specific Package was necessary.

- linux-kernel-515 v5.15.167-1, v6.10.10-1-latest
Weekly Linux Kernel updates. As usual, refer to [Greg Kroah-Hartman's announcements](https://lwn.net/Articles/990044/) for more details.

#### Epilogue
Qubes OS [summit 2024](https://vpub.dasharo.com/e/16/qubes-os-summit-2024) did take place in Berlin from 20th to 22nd September. Link to presentation videos are available in [this post](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qubes-os-summit-2024-day-1-2-vods/29122). There are many hints and clues on what is coming to R4.3 and what is not.
