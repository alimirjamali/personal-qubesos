. Qubes OS posted [QSB-109](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qsb-109-intel-microcode-updates/35535) on the mentioned vulnerabilities and made the microcode to fix them available (currently in testing repos).

* **vmm-xen** [v4.19.3-1](https://github.com/QubesOS/updates-status/issues/5918) (r4.3)
Xen is updated from 4.19.2 to 4.19.3. As a result of this, around 60 patch files are removed since they are already included in upstream.

#### Epilogue
After the release of r4.3 rc1, many users are already testing the release candidate. Most of the reported issues are related to in-place upgrades. Fortunately many of them are benign issues and hopefully could be resolved quickly.

We are also in summer break period in [Poland](https://publicholidays.pl/school-holidays/), EU and many parts of the world. Hopefully the vacation period would supercharge all team members who might be resting during this period.

I have been also taking some rest after few busy weeks. Hopefully this should be also over and I could be back on my small contributions.
