# `qubesimgconvertertt` & `qvm-get-image-tt` notes
Library and Utility for custom effects of Qubes OS VM icons. Provided effects 
are **overlay, thin-border, thick-border** as well as the standard _tint_ which
use the label color for their effects. Special filters of **untouched, invert,
mirror, flip** are also available. [Screenshots](#screenshots--demo) of Tweak
Tools effects are at the bottom of this page. Real-life use cases are 
documented and explained in [qubesappmenustt](/qubesappmenustt) and
[window-icon-updater-tt](/window-icon-updater-tt) sub-directories.

### Internals & Features
The `qubesimgconvertertt` library is derived from the original
[qubesimgconverter](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-linux-utils/tree/main/imgconverter/qubesimgconverter)
library and _Image_ class. Effects are written as individual methods.

The `qvm-get-image-tt` is an independent utility which could be used as a
drop-in replacement for `qvm-get-tinted-image`. Based on
[qubes-app-linux-img-converter](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-img-converter)
utilities with additional _--filter_ & _--mirror_ options which allows user to
select the desired filter. An extra _--ANSI_ function is provided to quickly
check the results directly within the terminal. A special _--alphacomposite_
option is available which allows composition of one image on another. By default,
`qvm-get-image-tt` checks for an special **ttfilter** VM feature and uses it to
determine the current Tweak Tool filter effect per VM. If the _ttfilter_ key is
not present or is invalid, the default tint effect will be applied. To change
the Tweak Tool filter effect of any VM:

```
qvm-features VMNAME ttfilter <tint|overlay|thin-border|thick-border|untouched|invert|mirror|flip>
```

### Installation & Removal
To install the library & tool at your _~/.local/lib_ & _~/bin_ directories, 
run this command in the current directory:
```
make install
```
To remove them from your system, run this command in the current directory:
```
make remove
```

### Limitations, Issues & ToDo
These are the current known limitation with the tool & library:
- Performance of the Tweak Tool effects are not evaluated and compared with the
default tint. They are already fast but there is always room for improvements.
- Original unit tests are performed on a 2x2 image. Mostly done from security
perspective. Not suitable for most of the Tweak Tool effects. Individual unit
tests are required.
- Currently tested only on Qubes OS 4.2.1
- Theoretically it should be possible to install the library and utility within
any Qube if the dependency (`python3-qubesimgconverter`) is installed in its
template. And if the necessary policies to allow it to retrieve Image from
destination VM(s) is granted. This is yet to be tested and documented.
- It should be noted that the current _systray_ effects are not implemented via
the `qubesimgconverter` library but are rather written in C language and a part of
[qubes-gui-daemon](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-gui-daemon/tree/main/gui-daemon)
repository. Further study of its mechanism is needed. Github Issue
[#2846](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2846) provides better
context.

### Screenshots & Demo
The untouched 32x32 pixel Icon of Ristretto. ANSI color representation of
output is printed to the terminal via __--ANSI__ option.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter untouched
```
![](effect-untouched.png)

The default __Tint__ effect. Original work by Wojciech Porczyk et. al.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter tint
```
![](effect-tint.png)

Overlaying image on the provided color using images Alpha channel.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter overlay
```
![](effect-overlay.png)

Thin and Thick borders. Bordering supports percentage of image instead of fixed
pixel count. This allows consistent results on HiDPI displays. The anti-aliased 
1.536 pixel width thin-border for 32x32 icons is much more distinguishable and
comfortable than the fixed 1 pixel width.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter thin-border
```
![](effect-thin-border.png)
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter thick-border
```
![](effect-thick-border.png)

Special invert effect is very useful for __untrusted__ VM. As it implies a
paranoid effect.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter invert
```
![](effect-invert.png)

Mirrored or flipped icons are not that much usable as in practice, our brains do
not register them well as distinguishable effects.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/org.xfce.ristretto.png --ANSI pattern --filter untouched --mirror horizontal
```
![](effect-mirrored.png)

Alpha Compositing 16x16 pixel Firefox icon on Chrome icon. This effect could be
useful for compositing qube icon on application icons. It is necessary to
consult professional UI/UX experts for better feedback.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0x0000FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/firefox.png --ANSI pattern --filter untouched --alphacomposite /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/google-chrome.png
```
![](effect-alphacompositor.png)

Mixed effects are feasible. Here is a mirrored Wilber (GIMPâ€™s macot), tinted
with Magenta, finally composited on Qubes OS icon.
```
qvm-get-image-tt personal 0xFF00FF /usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/gimp.png --mirror horizontal --filter tint --alphacomposite /usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps/qubes-logo-icon.png --ANSI pattern
```
