# Tools, Configs, Customization & Tweaks for Qubes OS

## Tools for DOM0 / ManagementVM
### qubes-template-update
This tool was originally created during my Qubes OS 3.2 days. I had to download
updates for many templates during night to circumvent daily download caps.
I added installation, search and remove functionality at later stages. After
being away from Qubes OS for a long time and returning to Qubes OS 4.2, some
parts of it has become obsolete because of the modern Salt interface. Yet it is
still useful as many of its features are not implemented via Salt.
